# v0.4.0 Test & Experiment Tracker

This document captures and organises the experiments and tests for version `v0.4.0`, focusing on the updated prompt matching logic, diagnostics, and alias handling improvements.

---

## Version Summary

Version `v0.4.0` introduces significant enhancements to alias matching, including:

* Token-level alias scanning
* Improved diagnostics (alias tracking and fallback reasoning)
* Multi-token alias support
* Refactored structure for maintainability

These changes require structured validation to confirm improvements over prior versions and catch regressions.

---

## Testing Approach

Each test includes:

* **Input**: The user query.
* **Matched Concept**: What alias/concept was resolved.
* **Resolved Prompt**: The prompt used for generation.
* **Output**: The model’s response.
* **Observations**: Notes on correctness, match quality, hallucinations, or safety concerns.

## Planned Tests

| Input Example                                | Expected Match   | Notes                                     |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| "Explain black holes like I’m five"          | `explain_simple` | Multi-token alias match ("like I'm five") |
| "Summarise this article"                     | `summarise`      | Variant of common summarisation request   |
| "Tell me a joke"                             | `funny_response` | Should resolve with a humour prompt       |
| "What’s the difference between RAM and SSD?" | `compare_items`  | Checks complex phrase match               |
| "Who painted the Mona Lisa?"                 | `base_prompt`    | Valid query with no specialized concept   |

More test cases will be added as development progresses.

## Status

This file serves as both a checklist and central summary of test results for the release. Once testing concludes, results will be included inline or linked to a dedicated markdown log.
